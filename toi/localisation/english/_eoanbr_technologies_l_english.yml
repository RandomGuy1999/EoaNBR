 tech_naval_mtg_explosive_shells: "Explosive Shells"
 tech_naval_mtg_explosive_shells_desc: "Explosive Shells, if set off inside an enemy ship hull could cause massive amounts of damage."
 tech_naval_mtg_early_cannons: "Early Cannons"
 tech_naval_mtg_early_cannons_desc: "Early smoothbore cannons consisted of 24lber and 32lber weapons, where the weight of shot described the gun. 12lber guns were often used a an early form of secondary armament."
 tech_naval_mtg_heavy_smoothbores: "Heavy Smoothbores"
 tech_naval_mtg_heavy_smoothbores_desc: "As the early 19th century progressed, larger more destructive cannons were required to tackle sailing ships of increasing size, resulting in a new standard heavy armament firing roundshot weighing around 68 british pounds."
 tech_naval_mtg_rbl_battery: "Breech Loading Cannons"
 tech_naval_mtg_rbl_battery_desc: "The third branch of weapons development occuring at this time was trying to create a rifled but breech-loading weapon. Historically examples of this generation of RBL artillery were prone to accidents and misfires, and were usually replaced with RML weapons."
 tech_naval_mtg_studded_shells: "Studded Shells"
 tech_naval_mtg_studded_shells_desc: "Studded Palliser Shells were an early form of armor-piercing shell, which were pointed to enhace their penetrative capabilities, and contained an explosive filler to enhance their inflicted damage."
 tech_naval_mtg_SH_smoothbores: "Super Heavy Smoothbores"
 tech_naval_mtg_SH_smoothbores_desc: "As ships became increasingly large, powerful, and armored, larger and more destructive weapons were called for, and so smoothbore cannons were taken to their logical extreme, with some smoothbores reaching projectile sizes 15 inches across or more."
 tech_naval_mtg_hollow_cast_guns: "Hollow Casting Techniques"
 tech_naval_mtg_hollow_cast_guns_desc: "A common problem with mid 19th-century heavy artillery is that often the bore-pressures generated by accelerating increasingly heavy projectiles caused the guns to fail and become unusable, not to mention the chance of wounding or killing the crew. A new fabrication technique called 'Hollow Casting' was the solution at that time. Through a complicated procedure, the molten metal in the gun was made to cool from the outside in. As the outer layers cooled faster, the center of the gun would be squeezed by the outer layers, creating a stronger cannon."
 tech_naval_mtg_modern_ironclad_rams: "Modern Ironclad Rams"
 tech_naval_mtg_modern_ironclad_rams_desc: "Although the development of bigger and bigger batteries will likely end ramming as a viable naval warfare tactic, ironclads can still fulfill this role. Specialized rams will be constructed for this purpose."
 tech_naval_mtg_rml_battery: "Rifled Muzzle Loading Cannons"
 tech_naval_mtg_rml_battery_desc: "Another branch of weapon development that became more practical at this time was rifled cannons firing elongated shot and shell. These weapons were often disproportionately massive and heavy to contain the much higher breech pressures rifled cannons must deal with."
 tech_naval_mtg_central_battery_armament: "Central Battery Armament"
 tech_naval_mtg_central_battery_armament_desc: "As ships began to armor themselves against earlier naval artillery, and heavier armor began to slow down ships more than their protection justified, a new strategy was required. As such new ironclads were designed with fewer, far more destructive guns arranged in the center broadsides, surrounded by a smaller more heavily armored citadel, which could be viewed as an early implementation of an 'All-or-nothing' armor scheme."
 tech_naval_mtg_sails: "Sails"
 tech_naval_mtg_sails_desc: "A form of naval propulsion tried and tested since times immemorial, sails might be put out of service by the rapid advancement of industrial technology today soon, but for now, they work and have been proven to work for centuries."

 tech_naval_mtg_tubular_boilers: "Tubular Boilers"
 tech_naval_mtg_tubular_boilers_desc: "Tubular boilers succeeded earlier box boilers due to the advantage of their shape. Tubular boilers minimized the material required to build a boiler while maximizing volume; simultaneously the rounded shape prevented steam pressure from building up near seams in the boiler, increasing the safe limit of steam pressures, allowing for even more powerful engines."
 tech_naval_mtg_oscillating_engine: "Oscillating Engines"
 tech_naval_mtg_oscillating_engine_desc: "The penultimate design when it comes to single-expansion paddle engines, Oscillating Engines are a yet more compact design for a steam engine optimized for low RPM that paddle engines need. Their advantage is the elimination of even more inefficient moving parts, and uniquely allowing the steam pistons to rotate freely"
