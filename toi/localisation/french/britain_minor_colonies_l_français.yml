#Britishoceania

 britishoceania.4.d: "Two American citizens on the Fijian island of Waya have been killed and cannibalized by the locals. We must answer this outrage imeediately, justice for the slain if nothing else!"
 britishoceania.4.a: "Dispatch an expedition immediately, we will have justice!"
 britishoceania.4.b: "It was only a couple of sailors, how much do they really matter?"
 britishoceania.5.t: "Expedition arrives at Fiji!"
 britishoceania.5.d: "Our ships have arrived after a long voyage in the vicinity of the Fijian island of Waya and are about to begin landing. A message from the chief of the tribe that murdered our citizens was waiting for us, apparently the natives were warned of our coming, or foresaw that we would come. It reads 'Do you suppose we have killed the two white men for nothing? No, we killed them and we have eaten them. We are great warriors, and we delight in war.' [sic]. We will see how powerful these great warriors really are."
 britishoceania.5.a: "Captain, commence the landing."
 britishoceania.6.t: "Assault Begins!"
 britishoceania.6.d: "After a difficult trek across the island, our sailors have reached the village where our citizens were murdered. Sadly our only artillery piece fell off a cliff, but our firearms should be more than a match for their primitive weapons. Send a flanking force left, why should we make it easy for them?"
 britishoceania.6.a: "This will be over quickly"
 britishoceania.7.t: "Victory!"
 britishoceania.7.d: "Our sailors were victorious. The engagement lasted less than an hour. The natives were no match for our new rifles. Our artillerists, who tragically lost their raison d'etre off the side of a cliff, are currently burning some of the huts in the village in retaliation for our murdered citizens, and the tribe chief who sent us the taunting note is confirmed among the enemy dead. The brightest spot among all this is that we suffered nothing more than light wounds, one sailor who suffered a flesh wound to their leg is the worst hurt, and will be returning to service within a couple days. Hopefully this will serve as an object lesson for any others who seek to hurt our citizens!"
 britishoceania.7.a: "And a safe return journey"
